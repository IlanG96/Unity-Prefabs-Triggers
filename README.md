# Unity week 2: Formal elements

The game is a simple space shooter, where the player controls a spaceship and shoots at enemies. The enemies are spawned randomly.
I've added a few formal elements to the game, such as a ability to get "life" in the game and a 5 sec cooldown for the spaceship laser.
